// F3 from unidoc-alip's review of PR #1: Download() used
// http.DefaultClient, which has no timeout at all - a server that
// accepts the connection and then stalls left check/update hanging
// indefinitely. Fixed with an explicit client Timeout; this test
// confirms that timeout is actually applied against a real server that
// genuinely never responds, not just that the client value is set.
//
// The reviewer's original harness swapped the transport for one that
// stalls but must itself honor req.Context() (http.Client.Timeout is
// implemented by cancelling the request context - a RoundTripper that
// ignores it blocks regardless, which is exactly the bug the reviewer
// found in their own first draft of that harness). Using a real
// httptest.Server instead sidesteps that entirely: its connection goes
// through the real net/http transport, which does honor context
// cancellation correctly, so this test only needs to swap where
// Download() points and how long it's willing to wait.
